        <h1>Altoids Tin Computer</h1><br<br><br>
        Aah, what a disappointment this project was. Despite my best efforts, I was never able to get this computer to work. <br>
        I suspect during the building process, I fried one of the ICs from being improperly grounded while working with the <br>
        components. This computer would have fitted into an altoids tin and was programmable via flipping the switches up and <br>
        down on the front panel to key the program in. Every command had to be put in sequentially, so a serial interface <br>
        was also usable on this computer to allow easier keying in of programs. Of course, this never worked either and thus <br>
        this whole project was somewhat of a disappointment. Still, it was very fun to build and I did learn a lot in the process. <br>
