        <h1>Z80 MBC2</h1><br<br><br>
        This is the Z80 MBC2 I built a few years ago. it features MicroSD card support allowing it to use many gigabytes of ROM. <br>
        It additionally features 128K of banked RAM, and uses CP/M 3.0, CP/M 2.0 and MS BASIC as its operating systems. Despite <br>
        it being a very powerful system, especially compared to my pocket computer and Altoids computer, I never actually programmed <br>
        on it very much at all. Using assembly language on the system is all but completely undocumented, leading me to lose interest <br>
        in attempting to do it. Still, it was very fun to solder together and works perfectly even years after it was built! <br>
